What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This creates the metadata that will be used by git to maintain the repository. This is necessary to track the changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is between the working directory which is completely out of source control and the repository which is completely in.  This seems to be a good place to organize the files that should be included in the commit and would help to facilitate a logical grouping of the files.
